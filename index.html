             <p> Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, 
                 meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.
                 It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also
                 available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
             </p>
             <p> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data 
                 structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant
                 syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
                 scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. <br>
                 The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary
                 form for all major platforms from the Python Web site https://www.python.org/.

            <header>Characteristics Of Python</header>
            <p>Following are important characteristics of Python Programming</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
                <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
                <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
                <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
                <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section"  id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Let's start writing your first "Hello world" Python code</p>
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        # print statement <br>
        print("Hello World !")
        </code></pre>
        </div>    
        </section>

        <section class="main-section"  id="Variable">
            <header>Variable</header>
            <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create
                 a variable you reserve some space in memory. <br>
                 Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be 
                 stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can 
                 store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
            </p>
            <h3>Assign Value to Variable</h2>
            <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens 
                automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to 
                variables. <br>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the 
                operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.
            </p>
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        # assign an int value of 100 to variable x <br>
        x = 100  <br> 
        # assign a str value "John" to variable fName<br> 
        fName = "John" <br> 
        # str value can place in single/double quotes <br> 
        lName = 'Smith' 
        </code></pre>

            <header>Data Type</header>
            <p>In programming, data type is an important concept. <br>
                Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. <br>                
                Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

            <header>Decision Making</header>
            
            <p>Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and 
                specifying actions taken according to the conditions. <br>
                Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. 
                You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE 
                or FALSE. <br>              
                Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the 
                programming languages.  
            </p>
            <img src="image/condition.PNG" width="300" height="300" class="condition-img" alt="decision making structure image">
            <span>Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as TRUE, and if it is 
                either zero or null, then it is assumed as FALSE value.</span>
            <h3>Python programming language provides following types of decision making statements.</h3>
            <p>An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>  
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        num1 = 4 <br> 
        num2 = 6 <br> 
        if num1 < num2: <br>
            print("num1 is smaller than num2")
        </code></pre>
        </div>
            <p>An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.</p>
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        num1 = 14 <br> 
        num2 = 6 <br> 
        if num1 < num2: <br>
            print("num1 is smaller than num2") <br>
        else: <br>
            print("num1 is greater than num2")
        </code></pre>
        </div>
            <p>There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition 
                resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.
            </p>
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        x, y = 10, 20 <br>
        if x > y: <br>
            print("x is greater than y") <br>
        elif x == y: <br>
            print("x is equal to y") <br>
        else: <br>
            print("x is smaller than y")

            <h3>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</h3>
                    <p>While Loop. Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE.
                        It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

        <header>Define Function</header>
        <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to 
            define a function in Python.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ).</li>
                <li>Information can be passed into functions as arguments,and specified after the function name, 
                    inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma..</li>
                <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
                <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression 
                    to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is an example of how to define a function and call a function</p> 
        <div>
        <pre><code>
        # define a function <br>
        def fullName(fName, lName):  <br>
            print(fName + " " + lName) <br>
        # call the function <br>
            fullName("YK", "Tamrakar")
        </code></pre>
